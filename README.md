# LaunchDarkly Lambda Logger

A feature flag-controlled console logging utility for AWS Lambda functions that integrates with LaunchDarkly. This logger enables dynamic control over log levels through LaunchDarkly feature flags, allowing you to adjust logging verbosity in real-time without deploying code changes. Note: This utility is specifically designed for console logging with dynamic log levels - it does not handle or display LaunchDarkly SDK flag evaluation events.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Dynamic Log Level Control**: Adjust console log levels in real-time using LaunchDarkly feature flags
- ðŸŽ¨ **Emoji-Enhanced Logging**: Visual distinction between log levels using emojis
- ðŸ“Š **Multiple Log Levels**: Support for FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, and TRACE levels
- âš¡ **AWS Lambda Optimized**: Designed for use in AWS Lambda functions
- ðŸ”§ **Configurable SDK Logging**: Control LaunchDarkly SDK's own logging behavior
- ðŸ”„ **Flexible Client Integration**: Works with either a new LaunchDarkly client or an existing one from your application, preventing duplicate client instances

## Log Levels

The logger supports the following levels (in order of increasing verbosity):

- `FATAL` (ðŸ’€): Unrecoverable errors that require immediate attention
- `ERROR` (ðŸ”´): Severe errors that don't prevent the system from running
- `WARN` (ðŸŸ¡): Potentially harmful situations
- `INFO` (ðŸ”µ): General operational messages
- `DEBUG` (âšª): Detailed information for debugging purposes
- `TRACE` (ðŸŸ£): Very detailed debugging information

Each level includes all levels above it in the hierarchy. For example, if the log level is set to INFO, all FATAL, ERROR, and WARN messages will also be logged.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @bradbunce/launchdarkly-lambda-logger
```

## Usage

### Environment Variables

- `LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY`: (Required) The LaunchDarkly feature flag key used to control log levels
- `LD_SDK_LOG_LEVEL`: (Optional) Controls the LaunchDarkly SDK's own logging level (error, warn, info, or debug)

### Initialization Options

The logger can be initialized in two ways:

1. With a LaunchDarkly SDK key (creates a new client):
   ```javascript
   await logger.initialize('YOUR_SDK_KEY', context, {
     logLevelFlagKey: 'your-flag-key' // Optional: overrides LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY env var
   });
   ```

2. With an existing LaunchDarkly client (recommended if your app already has one):
   ```javascript
   const ldClient = LaunchDarkly.init('YOUR_SDK_KEY');
   await logger.initialize(ldClient, context, {
     logLevelFlagKey: 'your-flag-key' // Optional: overrides LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY env var
   });
   ```

Using an existing client is recommended when your application already has a LaunchDarkly client instance, as it prevents creating duplicate connections and reduces resource usage.

### Important Note

This utility is focused solely on providing console logging with dynamic log levels controlled by LaunchDarkly. It does not log or display LaunchDarkly SDK flag evaluation events. If you need to monitor flag evaluations, you should set up event listeners directly on your LaunchDarkly client:

```javascript
ldClient.on('update', (settings) => {
  console.log('Flag update received:', settings);
});

ldClient.on('change', (settings) => {
  console.log('Flag change detected:', settings);
});
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
const { logger } = require('@bradbunce/launchdarkly-lambda-logger');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  // Set the flag key via environment variable
  process.env.LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY = 'your-log-level-flag';
  
  // Initialize the logger with your LaunchDarkly SDK key and context
  await logger.initialize('YOUR_SDK_KEY', {
    kind: 'user',
    key: 'lambda-function-1'
  });

  // OR use an existing LaunchDarkly client
  const ldClient = LaunchDarkly.init('YOUR_SDK_KEY');
  await logger.initialize(ldClient, {
    kind: 'user',
    key: 'lambda-function-1'
  });

  try {
    // Use different log levels as needed
    await logger.info('Lambda function started');
    await logger.debug('Processing event:', event);
    
    // Your lambda function logic here
    
    await logger.info('Lambda function completed successfully');
    return { statusCode: 200 };
  } catch (error) {
    await logger.error('Lambda function failed:', error);
    throw error;
  } finally {
    // Always close the logger to clean up resources
    await logger.close();
  }
};
```

## Configuration

### LaunchDarkly Feature Flag

The logger uses a feature flag to control the log level. The flag key must be set via the `LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY` environment variable or the `logLevelFlagKey` initialization option. Create this flag in your LaunchDarkly project with the following configuration:

- **Key**: Set via `LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY` environment variable or `logLevelFlagKey` option
- **Type**: Number
- **Default value**: 1 (ERROR level)
- **Possible values**:
  - 0: FATAL only
  - 1: ERROR and above
  - 2: WARN and above
  - 3: INFO and above
  - 4: DEBUG and above
  - 5: TRACE and above

### SDK Logging

You can control the LaunchDarkly SDK's own logging level by setting the `LD_SDK_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```javascript
process.env.LD_SDK_LOG_LEVEL = 'error'; // error, warn, info, or debug
```

## API Reference

### Logger Methods

- `initialize(sdkKeyOrClient: string | Object, context: Object, options?: Object): Promise<void>`
  - Initializes the logger with either a LaunchDarkly SDK key or an existing LaunchDarkly client instance
  - When using a SDK key, a new client will be created
  - When using an existing client, the logger will use that client instead of creating a new one
  - Options:
    - `logLevelFlagKey`: Override the LD_LOG_LEVEL_FLAG_KEY environment variable
  - Must be called before using any logging methods

- `fatal(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs a fatal error message (ðŸ’€)
  - Use for unrecoverable errors requiring immediate attention

- `error(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs an error message (ðŸ”´)
  - Use for severe but non-fatal errors

- `warn(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs a warning message (ðŸŸ¡)
  - Use for potentially harmful situations

- `info(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs an informational message (ðŸ”µ)
  - Use for general operational information

- `debug(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs a debug message (âšª)
  - Use for detailed debugging information

- `trace(...args: any[]): Promise<void>`
  - Logs a trace message (ðŸŸ£)
  - Use for very detailed debugging information

- `close(): Promise<void>`
  - Closes the LaunchDarkly client connection
  - Should be called when the logger is no longer needed
